            <h6>What is Infinite Afternoon?</h6>
            <p>Infinite Afternoon gives you always-changing ambient music, available on the web.</p>
            <p>All notes and effects on top of the 'base loop' are played at randomly selected intervals. Due to these intervals, every user will hear completely unique interplay between notes, no matter how many times you refresh or how long you leave it open. </p>
            <p>Infinite Afternoon is inspired by Brian Eno's piece 'Thursday Afternoon'. Eno's piece is ultimately limited in time due to the nature of music distribution, while Inifinite Afternoon could potentially go on forever.</p>

            <h6>What techniques are used to make Infinite Afternoon?</h6>
            <p>I have created the samples with Ableton Live.</p>
            <p>The page is created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery. In JavaScript I use the Web Audio API to play and manipulate the audio files.</p>
            <p>The 'drops' you see are aligned with the panning of the notes.</p>
